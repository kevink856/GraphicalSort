# GraphicalSort

### Application that displays an animation representation of several sorting algorithms.


<br>
<br>
**(!)** This repository is a **fork** from the [first version](https://replit.com/@lite/Actual-Graphical-Sort?v=1) I made in 2021, which had no animation and had all of the functioning code in a single Java file. This version is a revisit of that application, and is a re-formatted, re-organized, and updated version of that project.

## TODO:
* Add MIDI sounds upon each traversal of array
* Add other sorting algorithms
* Implement new animations (?)
